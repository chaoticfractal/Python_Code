# Python_Code-
This repo contains Python code that I wrote while learning the language. I will continute to add more and more code to this while I continue to advance my skills in Python. Currently it will contain mainly smaill little pieces of code that I wrote while working with sources like codcademy and similar others. I will continue to add to this repo as I create more programs in Python with the focus mainly on machine learning and numerical analysis algorithms.
